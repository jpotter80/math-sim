# Sieve of Eratosthenes

## Overview

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer. It is one of the most efficient ways to find small prime numbers.

The algorithm works by iteratively marking as composite (not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from that prime, with constant difference between them equal to that prime.

## Implementation

The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is implemented in `sieve_of_eratosthenes.py`. It uses the `ResourceMonitor` class to track memory and CPU usage during the calculation.

Key features:
- Generates all prime numbers up to a given limit
- Efficiently marks multiples as composite
- Tracks resource usage throughout the calculation

## Visualization

The `sieve_viz.py` file provides tools to visualize the prime numbers generated by the Sieve of Eratosthenes:

1. Prime Spiral (Ulam Spiral): A graphical representation where numbers are arranged in a spiral, and prime numbers are highlighted. This visualization often reveals interesting patterns in the distribution of primes.

2. Prime Distribution: A plot showing the distribution of prime numbers up to the given limit, where each prime is represented by a point.

## Usage

To generate prime numbers and create visualizations:

1. Navigate to the `math_sim` directory
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   python -m math_sim.main --sieve 1000
   ```
   Replace 1000 with any positive integer to specify the upper limit for prime generation.

## Interpretation

- The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently identifies all prime numbers up to a given limit
- The Prime Spiral visualization often reveals diagonal, vertical, and horizontal lines, suggesting patterns in the distribution of primes
- The Prime Distribution plot shows how primes become less dense as numbers increase
